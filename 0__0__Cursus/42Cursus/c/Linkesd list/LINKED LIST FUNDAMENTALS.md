## What is a Linked List?

- A linked list is a linear [data structure](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-article "data structure") that stores a collection of data elements dynamically
- **Nodes** represent those data elements, and links or pointers connect each node
- Each **node** consists of two fields, the information stored in a linked list and a **pointer that stores the address of its next node**.
- it does not waste memory space. [[Why linked list doesn't waste memory spacr]]
