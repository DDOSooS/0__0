```def
A deadlock, in the context of computer science, is a situation where two or more processes (or threads) are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource before they can proceed. This essentially creates a stalemate, where none of the processes can make any progress, leaving them stuck indefinitely.
```

Here's a breakdown of the key elements of a deadlock:

- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Resources</mark>:** These are objects or entities needed by processes to execute. Examples include memory, files, devices, or even mutexes (used for resource synchronization).

- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Processes</mark>:** These are independent execution units within a program that run concurrently.

- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Waiting</mark>:** A process enters a waiting state when it needs a resource currently held by another process.

- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Circular Dependency</mark>:** This occurs when each process in the deadlock is waiting for a resource held by another process in the chain, forming a circular dependency.

Here's an example to illustrate:

Imagine two processes, **Process A** and **Process B**, both needing access to two files: **File 1** and **File 2**.

1. Process A acquires **File 1**.
2. Process B acquires **File 2**.
3. Process A then tries to acquire **File 2**, but it's blocked because Process B already holds it.
4. Similarly, Process B tries to acquire **File 1**, but it's blocked because Process A already holds it.

Both processes are now stuck waiting for each other, creating a deadlock. They cannot release the resources they hold because they need the resources held by the other process to proceed.

**Consequences of Deadlocks:**

Deadlocks can have significant consequences, including:

- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Reduced System Performance</mark>:** Deadlocked processes consume resources even though they are not making any progress. This can hinder the performance of the entire system.
- **I<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ncreased Program Complexity</mark>:** Implementing mechanisms to prevent deadlocks adds complexity to the programming logic.
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Hard-to-debug Issues</mark>:** Diagnosing and resolving deadlocks can be challenging and time-consuming.

**Preventing Deadlocks:**
---
Several techniques can help prevent deadlocks, such as:

- **Mutual Exclusion:** Ensure only one process can access a resource at a time.
- **Ordered Resource Acquisition:** Define a specific order in which processes can acquire resources to avoid circular dependencies.
- **Timeout Mechanisms:** Introduce timeouts for resource acquisition to prevent processes from waiting indefinitely.
- **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:** Implement algorithms to detect deadlocks and recover from them when they occur.

```summary
Understanding the concept of deadlocks is crucial for developing efficient and reliable concurrent programs. By employing appropriate techniques, you can minimize the risk of deadlocks and ensure your system remains functional and responsive.
